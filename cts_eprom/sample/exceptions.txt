; Exception-Word Encoding Scheme:
; 
; To store a unique word or symbol and its corresponding allophone address string 
; in an efficient and flexible manner, the following encoding format was derived:
; 
;    <[encoded word or symbol]< = [encoded allophone address(es)]
; 
;    where < equals 13H
;          [ equals 40H
;          ] equals 80H
; 
; The first and last bytes is 13H. This informs the code-to-speech algorithm 
; that the word or symbol is not a prefix or suffix.
; If the word or symbol is an individual letter, then the representation of it 
; between the brackes is an FFH; this includes the value of the left and right
; brackets. If it is a number or punctuation, then it is represented by its 
; value from TABLE-1 plus the value of the left and right brackets.
; 
; Otherwise.
; (1) The first letter in the word or symbol is always to be ignored; this does 
;     not apply to numbers or punctuation.
; (2) The next letter in the word is represented by the value of the letter from 
;     TABLE-1, plus the value of the left bracket "[" which is 40H.
; (3) The following letter(s), if and only if it is not the last letter in the 
;     word or symbol, is represented solely by its value from TABLE-1.
; (4) The last letter in the word or symbol is represented by the value of the 
;     letter from TABLE-1, plus the value of the right bracket "]" which is 80H.
;
; NOTE: the values from TABLE-1 are represented in the source code as the ASCII values of the letter or number - 20H
;
; The allophone address string is encoded in a similar manner:
; 
; If only one allophone is used for the pronounciation, it is represented by 
; its value from TABLE-2, plus the value of the left "[" and right "]" 
; brackets which are 40H and 80H respectively.
; 
; Otherwise:
; 
; (1) The first allophone is represented by its value from TABLE-2, plus the 
;     value of the left bracket "[" which is 40H.
; (2) The following allophone(s), if and only if it is not the last allophone in
;     the string, is represented by its value from TABLE-2.
; (3) The last allophone is represented by its value from TABLE-2 
;      plus the value of the right bracket "]" which is 80H.
; 
; Example: To encode "Au" to pronounce as "GOLD"
;          <[Au]< = [GG2 OW LL DD1]
;          13, F5, 13, 7D, 35, 2D, 95 <--This line is ready to store in
;              ^                         EXCEPTION-WORD EPROM under the
;              |                         "A" category. (The encoded string
;              |                         is shown in Hex notation.)
;              |
;              +--Remember, throw away the first letter (in this case an "A"), 
;                 then find the value of the next letter in TABLE-1 and add 
;                 40H plus 80H to it so as to represent the left "[" and right "]" brackets.
; 
; For words, the leading "<" (which marks the start of a word) is mandatory. 
; The trailing "<" (which marks the end of the word) is optional, and if it's 
; left off it marks the word as a prefix form. This allows constructs such as:
; 
;    <[CAP]A=[KK1 EY PP] ; CAPABILITY, CAPABLE
; 
; Without this, "capable" would be pronounced "cap-able", whereas it ought to 
; be "cape-able".
; 
; For symbols, both the leading and trailing "<"s are optional. This allows symbols
; to occur in the middle of a word (e.g. "up&down" would become "up and down" with 
; the example exception list).
